# Program 5: Decision Tree Classification

## Objective
Implement a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify iris flowers based on their features using the scikit-learn library.

## Overview
Decision Trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values to create a tree-like structure of decisions.
